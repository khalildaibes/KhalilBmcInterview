this is the progress of solving the task
first i have read the task word file a couple of times


strting with the planing:
1- make a tree command alike code
2-connect to remoter host
3 find a way to run the code on the other machines.
4-test the programm
5-try to refactor the code
6-return to 4 until its stable
7-try with more than on machine
8-repeate 4-6
9-see more options and try to optimize
10- apply ci/cd


1**** make a tree command alike code
    first a made a python code  on my local machine that behavis like the tree command
    is was so simple using the os module and recursive calls
-------------------------------------------------------
       * take the input as "host|root directory,host|root directory"
        find a way to split the argument to sipral "host|root directory"
        for each argument from the input create a thread to run the tree function on the "root"
        print the output for each Host as a continus output (async).

       * create the tree function.

       * check the output.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
    ** using the paramiko module we can establish a SSH connection to the remote host
        i used a dummy command to try out the connecting status

        first i created a VM on ubunto in mu local enviroment
        enable openssh on my machine
        enable ssh on the remote hsot
        --install paclages like paramiko to create the ssh connection
        read about the rsa progress and how to connect and verify the connection

        eabled the bridged netwrok option for ip poupse
        get the ip of the remote host
        create secure connection and apply a command wait for response and print it
